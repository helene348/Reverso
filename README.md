# Reverso

Reverso is a project given by my teacher during my formation. It's an application for an imaginary business named Reverso who wanted to create/modify/display/remove a client or a prospect. I realised it with IntelliJ (IDE) and it's written in JAVA and Swing.
I have realised it in 3 weeks.
